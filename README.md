- 👋 Hi, I’m @Crazy-Harvey
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Tek, mainly cyber-security and integrating it with physical security. I'm also looking into making a custom rom for the cat s22 flip (because they're cool, fight me. (side note: I will 100% give the rom the name KittyCatOS)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ but then i side track to python and then read articles about how rust is the future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever i can reasonably contribute to, which isn't alot right now.
- 📫 How to reach me (good luck, I'm like the cheshire cat. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yie3tTMFxBQ)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am the craziest out of two brothers. (hence the name)
